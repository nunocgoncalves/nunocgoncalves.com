I have been delaying the launch of the most basic Next.js website for over a month because I felt like I needed to over-engineer the heck out of it.

This was my plan:

- Run a Next server and PostgresSQL DB, in a HA setting in a K8s cluster in one of my home servers
- Do all routing using an HAProxy Ingress Controller and expose the Next server using my PfSense firewall
- Manage certificates and secrets with [Vault's](https://vaultproject.io) PKI (Private Key Infrastructure)
- And to wrap it all up, declare all the infracture in Terraform

To be fair, I do things like this on a daily basis at work ...

But sometimes, the desire for engineering excellence becomes your worst enemy. Meet the perfectionist, responsible for a lot of inaction in life.

Truth be said, the best projects are the ones that actually get shipped. Not the ones you spend months thinking about and that actually never get done. And even when they do, they are often so far off your initial expectations because you gave more thought to the idea than the work itself.

The fact that someone might be reading this just means I was able to take over the perfectionist. 

What did I do? I just shipped.

I went over to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and in 5mins this website was live.

Would my initial solution have worked any better than the 5min deployment with Vercel. Honestly, it would've likely performed worse. Covering all the process of deploying the over-engineered solution would've made a great blog (and it'll probably still happened) but it would've made it more likely for me to never ship the website.

Once perfectionism kicks in, nothing will ever be good enough. The more you do, the more you find out is "wrong". The longer you think about awesome ways to solve the inexistent problems the longer you'll perpetuate a cycle or rewarding on the premesis of ideas instead of working on your main proposition.

Ideas are good, acting is best.

So, just ship!
